=====================

This is a solution to Harvard's "CS50 Shuttle Game" problem set, which was added to the 2013 list of 'Nifty Assignments' at the annual SIGCSE meeting. These exercises can be found at http://nifty.stanford.edu/

The objective of this exercise was to edit the service.js file such that the pickup() and dropoff() functions would work correctly when the program was running in the Google Earth Plugin. The other files were supplied as is.
